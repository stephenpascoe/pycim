    An enumeration of types of ModelComponent. This includes things like atmosphere & ocean models, radiation schemes, etc. CIM best-practice is to describe every component for which there is a named ComponentType as a separate component, even if it is not a separate unit of software (ie: even if it is embedded), instead of as a (set of) ModelParameters. This codelist is synonomous with "realm" for the purposes of CMIP5.
