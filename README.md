[ES-DOC pycim-mp](http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/cog/es-doc/) - CIM Python Meta-Programming Utility
==================================================

What is ES-DOC ?
--------------------------------------

ES-DOC stands for Earth Science - Documentation.  It's goal is to provide software tools and services in order to support the distribution of earth science documentation.


What is the CIM ?
--------------------------------------

Metafor was a European project tasked with defining a metadata standard for describing scientific processes, particularly climate modelling processes.  This metadata standard came to be known as the CIM (Common Information Model).


What is pycim-mp ?
--------------------------------------

pycim-mp is an extensible CIM meta-progamming utility written in python.  It is an essential part of the CIM eco-system of tools & services that allows developers to work with CIM metadata in the encoding of their choice and in the programming language of their choice.

pycim-mp achieves this by parsing a pythonic representation of the CIM schema(s) and generating code in various programming languages.


Why pycim-mp ?
--------------------------------------

CIM metadata is typically encoded in an xml format that is complex in structure and large  in size.  Working with this xml directly is highly inefficient in terms of developer productivity.

It was clear that this issue could only be resolved by radically simplifying deserialisation of CIM metadata so that developers could work with plain objects in the programming language of their choice.


Who uses pycim-mp ?
--------------------------------------

pycim-mp supports the whole of the CIM eco-system of tools and services.
